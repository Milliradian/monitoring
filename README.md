Topics covered in the scripts are following

**1. R (intro)**
>_Introduction to the R Software and the Free and Open Source philosophy: how to deal with R making your first code!_

**2. Spatial R**
>_Introduction to the R Software and the Free and Open Source philosophy: how to deal with R making your first code!_

**3. Point Patterns Analysis**
>_Spatial statistics: deriving continuous maps from in-situ data, principles of autocorrelation and spatial interpolation_

**4. Multivariate analysis in R**
>_Population and community monitoring_

**5. Remote sensing in R**
>_Remote sensing: performing amazing spatio-temporal monitoring with satellite data at global scales_

>_Geographical data and reference systems: how to deal with the spatial reference of geographical data_

**6. Spatial statistics: let's analyse spatial data from the students' theses!**
>_Spatial statistics: deriving continuous maps from in-situ data, principles of autocorrelation and spatial interpolation_

**7. Multitemporal analysis** (e.g. NO2 before and after covid-19, indicators of global change - decrease in snow cover, deforestation)
>_Multitemporal analysis: monitoring change in time_

**8. Species Distribution Modelling**
>_Species distribution modelling: modelling the main drivers shaping species distributions_
